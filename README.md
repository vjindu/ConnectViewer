# ConnectViewer

The file:
- System names 
- Data being exchanged between systems
- connection type used to transfer the files
- Middleware (integration platform / ESB) used for data transformation

The application should:
- be able to import data from the file 
- Dynamically create a table structure based on the input file.
- create records of the systems if they do not exist or update if they exist.
- create records of connections between systems along with the data and connection types
- It should also be possible for the user to manually create records directly into the application and create new attributes for the system, data exchange, connection types etc.

Outputs :
The user should be able to create a query to see data exchange for a single system or all the systems or some systems. 
When the query is run, the application should be able to generate an visual diagram similar to the one in the attached file 'SampleforVijay-Output'
